# Typing-Tutor
Typing Tutor is a Project developed entirely in C programming language using Graphics Library.

# Problem Definition: 
There are many computer literate individuals but their efficiency is affected just because of their typing speeds or typing errors. 

•	This project must aim towards teaching the user on how to improve their typing in a fun and interesting manner .
•	After using this software the user should be able type efficiently without looking at the keyboard. 
•	It should test the user’s typing efficiency by providing accuracy and speed report after each test is undertaken.
•	So this way the user is tempted to improve typing speed the next time he takes test.
•	Training mode must be provided with some random letters and random words so as to allow the user to practice as much as possible.

# Methodology: 
Waterfall model is used. Reasons for using waterfall model are

•	Simple and easy to understand
•	Stages are defined clearly
•	Process and results are well documented
•	Phases are processed and completed one at a time
•	Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood
